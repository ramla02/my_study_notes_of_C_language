What is C?

• C is a general-purpose, procedural, compiled programming language.

Why C language?

• C is the mother of most if not all programming languages.
• So once you learn C programming, all other other languages becomes easy.
• C is an excellent choice for system programming, for example, developing operating systems, compilers, and network drivers.

The history of C:

• C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at bell laboratories of AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph), located in the U.S.A.
• The creater and founder  of C language is Dennis Ritchie.
• C is the offspring of both the B programming language and a language named BCPL,
which stood for (Basic Combined Programming Language.) But you have to admit that the B story is cute enough by itself.

The structure of C language:

• Documentation
• Preprocessor Section
• Definition
• Main() Function
• {
• block of code/statement
• }

Features of C Language:

• Simple
• Machine Independent or Portable
• Mid-level programming language
• structured programming language
• Rich Library
• Memory Management
• Fast Speed
• Pointers
• Recursion
• Extensible

1. Simple
C is a simple language in the sense that it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts), the rich set of library functions, data types, etc.

2. Machine Independent or Portable
Unlike assembly language, c programs can be executed on different machines with some machine specific changes. Therefore, C is a machine independent language.

3. Mid-level programming language
Although, C is intended to do low-level programming. It is used to develop system applications such as kernel, driver, etc. It also supports the features of a high-level language. That is why it is known as mid-level language.

4. Structured programming language
C is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify. Functions also provide code reusability.

5. Rich Library
C provides a lot of inbuilt functions that make the development fast.

6. Memory Management
It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.

7. Speed
The compilation and execution time of C language is fast since there are lesser inbuilt functions and hence the lesser overhead.

8. Pointer
C provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers. We can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array, etc.

9. Recursion
In C, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function. Recursion enables us to use the approach of backtracking.

10. Extensible
C language is extensible because it can easily adopt new features.
